# 🚀 Code Summarizer AI

AI-powered platform to understand, analyze, and interact with GitHub codebases using natural language.

---

## 📌 Overview

Code Summarizer AI is a full-stack intelligent system that helps developers quickly understand large and unfamiliar codebases.

Instead of manually reading files, users can:

- Import repositories
- Ask questions about the code
- Generate summaries
- Understand project structure

The system converts source code into vector embeddings and enables semantic search using AI.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Repository is imported
2. Code is chunked into smaller sections
3. Each chunk is converted into embeddings
4. Stored in vector database
5. User queries are matched using similarity search
6. AI generates context-based responses
